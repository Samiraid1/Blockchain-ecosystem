# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js

```

 Decentralized Voting DApp

A decentralized voting application built on the Ethereum blockchain using **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **React**, and **Ethers.js**.  
It allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, view proposals, and cast votes securely — ensuring transparency, fairness, and immutability.

##  Overview

This project demonstrates a simple **Voting DApp** where participants can vote for proposals on the Ethereum blockchain.  
Each vote is recorded immutably, and only one vote per wallet is allowed.  
The smart contract governs all rules — no central authority can alter or delete votes.

###  Goal
To create a **trustless and transparent voting mechanism** using blockchain technology, where results are verifiable and resistant to manipulation.

---

##  Features

-  **MetaMask Integration** — users connect their Ethereum wallet securely.
-  **Real-time Vote Counts** — dynamic updates after blockchain transactions.
-  **One Vote per Wallet** — enforced by smart contract logic.
-  **User Feedback** — transaction alerts and success/failure messages.
-  **Modern Frontend UI** — clean, minimal, and presentation-ready.
-  **Local or Testnet Deployment** — easily migrate from local Hardhat to public testnets.

##  Project Architecture

```

Frontend (React + Ethers.js)
↓
MetaMask (User Wallet)
↓
Local Blockchain (Hardhat Node)
↓
Smart Contract (Voting.sol)

````

### 🔍 Workflow

1. **User connects MetaMask** — app fetches wallet address.  
2. **Frontend uses Ethers.js** to communicate with the contract.  
3. **Smart Contract executes logic** — adds votes, enforces rules, stores data.  
4. **Blockchain updates persistently** — votes can’t be changed or deleted.  
5. **Frontend reloads** and shows updated results in real time.

##  Setup and Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/decentralized-voting-dapp.git
cd decentralized-voting-dapp
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Install Hardhat and required libraries

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox ethers
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Step 1 — Start a local blockchain

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This starts a local Ethereum network at **[http://127.0.0.1:8545](http://127.0.0.1:8545)**
You’ll see 20 pre-funded accounts with private keys (used for testing).

Keep this terminal **running** while you test your app.

---

### Step 2 — Deploy the smart contract

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy-voting.js
```

You’ll get an output like:

```
Contract deployed to: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
```

 Copy this contract address and paste it inside:
`frontend/src/App.js` → `const contractAddress = "0x..."`

---

### Step 3 — Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Visit **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
The app will open in your browser.

---

### Step 4 — Connect MetaMask

1. Install the **MetaMask browser extension** ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)).
2. Create or import a wallet.
3. Add a new **network**:

   ```
   Network name: Hardhat Localhost
   RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
   Chain ID: 31337
   Currency Symbol: ETH
   ```
4. Import one private key from the Hardhat node output.
5. Click **"Connect MetaMask"** in your app.
6. Cast your vote — MetaMask will ask you to confirm the transaction.

---

### Step 5 — Verify votes on the blockchain

You can open the Hardhat console to check votes directly:

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

Then run:

```js
const voting = await ethers.getContractAt("Voting", "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512");
(await voting.getProposal(0)).voteCount.toString();
(await voting.getProposal(1)).voteCount.toString();
```

##  Deployment Guide (for testnets)

To deploy on **Sepolia** or another Ethereum testnet:

1. Get free ETH from a [faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/).
2. Create an account on [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) or [Infura](https://infura.io/).
3. Update `hardhat.config.js`:

   ```js
   networks: {
     sepolia: {
       url: "https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>",
       accounts: ["0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"]
     }
   }
   ```
4. Deploy with:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deploy.js
   ```
5. Copy the new address into your `App.js`.
